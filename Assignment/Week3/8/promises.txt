Why promises?
While using CallBacks you can encounter something called the pyramid of doom/Callback hell.
(Async function calling another async function and so on)
When you have a Cb inside another Cb and one Cb inside that and so on, it also
becomes difficult to visualize it easily in the code structure

getA(){
    doX();
    doY();
    getB(data => {
        doX();
        doY();
        getC(data => {
            .......
            .......
        })
    })

}
